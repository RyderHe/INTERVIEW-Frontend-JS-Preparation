# 5.3 闭包

A **closure** is the combination of a function bundled together \(enclosed\) with references to its surrounding state \(the lexical environment\). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function.

{% hint style="info" %}
In JavaScript, **closures** are created every time a **function** is created, at **function creation time**.
{% endhint %}

## Lexical Scope / Static Scope

A lexical scope or static scope in JavaScript refers to the accessibility of the **variables, functions, and objects** based on their **physical location** in the source code.

```javascript
let a = 'global';

function outer() {
    let b = 'outer';
    function inner() {
        let c = 'inner'
        console.log(c);   // prints 'inner'
        console.log(b);   // prints 'outer'
        console.log(a);   // prints 'global'
    }
    console.log(a);     // prints 'global'
    console.log(b);     // prints 'outer'
    inner();
}

outer();
console.log(a);         // prints 'global'
```

* The `inner function` can access the variables defined in its own scope, the outer function’s scope, and the global scope.
* The `outer function` can access the variable defined in its own scope and the global scope.
* Why? Inner function is surrounded by the `lexical scope` of outer function which is, in turn, surrounded by the `global scope`.

The scope chain is like:

```text
Global {
  outer {
    inner
  }
}
```

## Dive into Closures

作用域应用的2种特殊情况：

1. 函数作为参数被传递

   ```javascript
    function print(fn) {
        const a = 200; // function scope
        fn();
    }

    //****************
    const a = 100; // global scope
    function fn() {
        console.log(a); // 真正的函数定义点 -> free varaible -> 往上级寻找
    }

    //*****************

    print(fn); // 100 执行
   ```

2. 函数作为返回值被返回

   ```javascript
    function create() {
        const a = 100; // function scope
        return function() {
            console.log(a); // 真正的函数定义点 -> free varaible -> 往上级寻找
        }
    }

    let fn = create();

    const a = 200; // global scope
    fn(); // 100 执行
   ```

   * `const a = 200` is defined in global scope
   * `const a = 100` is defined in function scope
   * a is free variable. When want to console log a , needs to find to upper scope, so find a = 100.

❗ 所有自由变量的查找: 自由变量的查找， 是在**函数定义**的地方，向上级作用域查找； 不是在一开始被执行的地方

## Closures Practical Examples

### Emulating private methods with closures

Private methods aren't just useful for restricting access to code. They also provide a powerful way of managing your global namespace.

```javascript
var counter = (function() {
  var privateCounter = 0;
  function changeBy(val) {
    privateCounter += val;
  }

  return { // thses 3 public methods are known a closure
    increment: function() { 
      changeBy(1);
    },

    decrement: function() {
      changeBy(-1);
    },

    value: function() {
      return privateCounter;
    }
  };
})();

console.log(counter.value());  // 0.

counter.increment();
counter.increment();
console.log(counter.value());  // 2.

counter.decrement();
console.log(counter.value());  // 1.
```

The lexical environment contains two private items: a variable called `privateCounter`, and a function called `changeBy`. You can't access either of these private members from outside the anonymous function. Instead, you can access them using the three public functions that are returned from the anonymous wrapper.

**Those three public functions are closures that share the same lexical environment**. Thanks to JavaScript's lexical scoping, they **each** have access to the `privateCounter` variable and the `changeBy` function.

What if we have more than one counter ?

```javascript
var counter1 = makeCounter(); // closure 1
var counter2 = makeCounter(); // closure 2

alert(counter1.value());  // 0.

counter1.increment();
counter1.increment();
alert(counter1.value()); // 2.

counter1.decrement();
alert(counter1.value()); // 1.
alert(counter2.value()); // 0.
```

A closure is **independent** to other closures.

Each closure references a **different version** of the `privateCounter` variable through its own closure.

Each time one of the counters is called, its lexical environment changes by changing the value of this variable. Changes to the variable value in one closure don't affect the value in the other closure.

## **Every closure has three scopes:**

1. Local Scope \(Own scope\)
2. Outer Functions Scope
3. Global Scope
