# 5.1 作用域

作用域指变量的合法适用范围

* **全局作用域** Global Scope

  The area outside all the functions is considered the global scope and the variables defined inside the global scope can be accessed and altered in any other scopes.

* **局部作用域** Local Scope

  Variables declared inside the functions become Local to the function and are considered in the corresponding local scope. **Every function has its own scope**. Same variable can be used in different functions because they are bound to the respective functions and are not mutual visible.

  * **函数作用域** Function Scope

    Whenever you declare a variable in a function, the variable is visible only within the function. You can't access it outside the function. **var** is the keyword to define variable for a function-scope accessibility.

  * **块级作用域** \(ES6 新增\) Block Scope

    Block scope is the area within if, switch conditions or for and while loops. Generally speaking, whenever you see {curly brackets}, it is a block. In ES6, **const** and **let** keywords allow developers to declare variables in the block scope, which means those variables exist only within the corresponding block.

    ```javascript
      if (true) {
          let x = 100;
      }
      console.log(x); // error
    ```

  ❓对比 Function Scope \(var\) & Block Scope \(const, let\):

  ```javascript
  function foo(){
        if(true){
            var fruit1 = 'apple';        //exist in function scope
            const fruit2 = 'banana';     //exist in block scope
            let fruit3 = 'strawberry';   //exist in block scope

        }
        console.log(fruit1); //apple
        console.log(fruit2); //error: fruit2 is not defined
        console.log(fruit3); //error: fruit3 is not defined
    }

  foo();
  ```
