# 6.1 单线程和异步

线程：thread

进程： process

🔷 JS 是**单线程**语言，只能同时做一件事

Javascript is a **single threaded** language. This means it has **one call stack and one memory heap**. As expected, it executes code in order and must finish executing a piece code before moving onto the next.

It's **synchronous**, but at times that can be **harmful**. For example, if a function takes awhile to execute or has to wait on something, it freezes everything up in the meanwhile.

A **good** example of this happening is the window alert function. `alert("Hello World").`You can't interact with the webpage at all until you hit OK and dismiss the alert. You're stuck.

🔷 浏览器和nodejs已支持JS启动进程, 如Web Worker

🔷 JS 和 DOM渲染 共同用一个线程，因为JS可修改DOM结构

🔷 遇到等待 \(网络请求, 定时任务\) 时, 不能卡住

🔷 需要**异步**来解决单线程带来的问题

🔷 **回调** callback 函数形式
